🔹 What is IAM?

IAM (Identity and Access Management) is an AWS service used to securely manage access to AWS resources by controlling:

Who can sign in

What they can do inside AWS

IAM = Login control + Permission control

🔹 Why IAM is required?

Without IAM:

Everyone would log in using root

Everyone would have full access

High security risk

With IAM:
✔ Each person gets their own login
✔ Permission can be restricted
✔ Sensitive resources are protected

🔹 IAM Root User vs IAM User
Feature	Root User	IAM User
Created when	AWS account is created	Manually by admin
Permissions	Unlimited	Based on policy
Usage	Only billing & emergency	Daily AWS operations

🛑 Never use root account for daily tasks.

🔹 IAM Groups

Group = A container for multiple IAM users with the same permissions.

Examples:

Group	Purpose
Admins	Full access
Developers	Development access only
Finance	Billing read-only

Users inherit permissions from the group.

🔹 IAM Policies

A policy is a JSON document that defines permissions.

Examples:

AdministratorAccess → Full access

AmazonEC2ReadOnlyAccess → Read EC2 only

AmazonS3FullAccess → Full S3 access

Policies can be attached to:

User

Group

Role

🔹 MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)

MFA adds a second layer of security during login:

Password

OTP generated by authenticator app

If password is leaked → AWS still stays safe.

🔹 Access Keys

Access keys allow programmatic access to AWS using:

AWS CLI

VS Code

Terraform

SDKs (Python, Node, Java)

CI/CD tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)

Access keys include:

Access Key ID
Secret Access Key


⚠ Secret Access Key is shown only once — must be stored securely.

🔹 AWS CLI (Command Line Interface)

AWS CLI allows you to manage AWS using commands instead of clicking the console.

Common CLI examples:

aws iam list-users
aws s3 ls
aws ec2 describe-instances


Region used: ap-south-1
Output: json

🔹 IAM Automation using AWS CLI

Create user:

aws iam create-user --user-name developer1


Add user to group:

aws iam add-user-to-group --user-name developer1 --group-name Admins


List users:

aws iam list-users


Automation is important for DevOps and large organizations.

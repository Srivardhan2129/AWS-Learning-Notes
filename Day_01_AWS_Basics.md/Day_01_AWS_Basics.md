🟦 Day 01 – AWS Basics
🔹 What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing means delivering computing services over the internet such as:

Servers

Storage

Databases

Networking

Analytics

Security

Applications

Instead of buying hardware, companies rent resources from a cloud provider like AWS.

🔹 Why Companies Use Cloud Computing
Traditional IT	Cloud Computing
Buy hardware	Rent resources
High initial cost	Pay-as-you-go
Slow deployment	Launch in minutes
Manual scaling	Auto scaling
Local access	Global access
🔹 AWS (Amazon Web Services)

AWS is the world’s #1 cloud provider with:

100+ services

High security

Lowest cost options

Global availability

Companies using AWS: Netflix, NASA, Samsung, Adobe, BMW, Meta, Airbnb, etc.

🔹 Region vs Availability Zone (AZ)
Term	Meaning
Region	A geographic location (e.g., Mumbai, Ohio, London)
Availability Zone	A data center inside a region (e.g., ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b)

📌 A region can have multiple AZs to provide high availability.

Example:

Region: ap-south-1 (Mumbai)
AZs: ap-south-1a, ap-south-1b, ap-south-1c

🔹 Shared Responsibility Model
AWS Responsibility	Customer Responsibility
Security of the cloud	Security in the cloud
Hardware	Data encryption
Network infrastructure	IAM users & permissions
Physical security	OS patching (EC2)
Hypervisor	Network settings (SG/NACL)
🔹 Key Terminologies
Term	Meaning
Scalability	Increase resources when demand increases
Elasticity	Auto increase/decrease resources based on usage
High Availability	System stays live if one component fails
Fault Tolerant	System works even if one AZ/data center fails
Pay-as-you-go	Pay only for what you use
